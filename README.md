# bedrock-gen-1.18
bedrock generation code so people dont have to wade through minecraft's spaghetti source code like i did

currently it displays the bedrock at y=-60 of the seed 694201337

compile with `gcc md5.c bedrockPatterns.c -o bedrockPatterns`

outputs a grid of text but its pretty easy to change
